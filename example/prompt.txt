Load and inspect the contents of question.json. For each question entry, generate the missing fields using only your internal knowledge and reasoning ability. 
Use sample_question.json and sample_answer.json as the formatting reference, and ensure the output strictly follows the same JSON schema. 
Do not modify field names or add new fields. Return only the final JSON FILE.
